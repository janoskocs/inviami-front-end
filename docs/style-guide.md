# 👁️ Style Guide

This project utilises Prettier and ESLint for code formatting. To check for linting errors, type `npm run lint`, then `npm run lint:fix` to attempt automatic issue fixing. Additionally, you can run `npm run format` to apply Prettier formatting to the code.

## Style Guide Enforcement

Husky will run ESLint and Prettier at each pre-commit to maintain consistent code formatting.
